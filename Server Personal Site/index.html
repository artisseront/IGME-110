        <p>Arthur is an audio engineer and voice actor based in Rochester, NY.
        Coming off of 7 years of experience creating electronic music, they have
        also worked on original animations, audio fiction productions, voiceover
        projects including demo reels, and video games. They also really like distortion. 
        A lot. It&#39;s probably unhealthy at this point, but whatever.
        </p>
        <p>Their full portfolio can be found on their actual personal site, <a href="https://www.arthurtaudio.com/.">ArthurTAudio.com</a>.
