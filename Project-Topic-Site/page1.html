        &emsp;The music of DOOM 2016 was, naturally, heavily inspired by the music of the original DOOM. The classic E1M1 riff, along with some other musical motifs, was kept, but the musical tone as a whole was really beefed up. Using a complex signal chain consisting mostly of distortion, Mick Gordon was able to turn a simple sine wave into a unique, driving bass tone, which he then added heavy metal guitar riffs, synths, and even samples of the DOOM chainsaw sound to. The level of attention to detail and the creativity with which the musical tone of the game was created all contribute to how great the sound ended up.

        &emsp;In the videos below, Gordon breaks down how he made the music for DOOM, and what inspired him to do so.
