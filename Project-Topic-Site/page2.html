            <i>"Change the process, change the outcome."</i> - Mick Gordon, DOOM Composer
        </p>
        <p>
        &emsp;This quote from, from Gordon's GDC talk about the soundtrack, describes his mindset for working on the DOOM soundtrack. The image above breaks down his "instrument" - that is, the signal processing chain that he arrived at after experimenting with more basic synthesis methods that he determined did not give him a desirable outcome for the tone of the game. Starting with a simple sine wave, this signal chain alone was enough to make a driving, powerful distorted bass instrument.

            &emsp;The music itself wasn't the only thing unique about the sountrack. The way the music was implemented into the game's engine was also a new technique.  Most modern games implement music using a purely environmentally-reactive system or in a layered stem system, to change the music as the player moves around and does different things.  DOOM 2016 breaks this convention in a very interesting way.  Instead of using a traditional system of adding or subtracting stems based on the intensity of what’s happening on screen, Gordon instead recorded up to or even more than 50 variants of the same tracks for each section of each track in each area of the game, each with slightly different composition, or beat, or tone.  This allowed the sections to loop effectively indefinitely until the player took a different action, or moved to a different area, or finished a level. This near-infinite variety allowed the music to perfectly match the tone of what the players was doing, regardless of whether it was an intense fight sequence or hunting for a collectible in the far corners of a secret area.
